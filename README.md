# Protocol :: Core

This application implements the core protocol of Sigma DAO, as defined in [the whitepaper](https://github.com/sigma-dao/protocol-whitepaper). This version of the protocol is implemented as a Java [ABCI application](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci) that uses Tendermint for consensus.
